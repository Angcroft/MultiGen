# MultiGen: Multiplication Table Generator (MTG)

## Introduction

**MultiGen** is a graphical application written in Java to generate and show a multiplication table from 1 to twelve. The user can input any any number and the program will do the rest. This project was created to learn about Java and is made available to the public for those who are also interested in this programming language and want to understand some of its syntax. MultiGen is a useful tool for Java learners as it offers a simple and clear graphical interface for performing multiplication tables.

## Features

* Enter the desired number.
* The program will loop from 1 to 12 for making the multiplication table.
* Intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.

To run this project, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. The project was developed using the latest available version of the JDK at the time, so it should work with recent versions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* **Main.java**: Contains the main method to start the application.
* **Calculation.java**: Implements the functionality of multiplication.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Angcroft/MultiGen.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd MultiGen
```

3. Compile the code:
```sh
javac Main.java Calculation.java
```

4. Run the application:
```sh
java -cp bin src.main.java.com.multigen.Main
```

## How It Works

When you run the program, a window will appear with a field to enter a number and a button to show results. Pressing the button will calculate the number and provide a multiplication table of the input number.

### Main Components

**Main Window**

* Text Field: To enter the number to multiply.
* Calculate Button: To initiate the multiplication.
* Result field: To display the multiplication table.

### Usage Example

**Basic BMI Calculation**

1. Open the application.
2. Enter any number.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. You will see your input number and the table of multiplications from 1 to 12.
