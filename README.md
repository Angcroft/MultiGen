# IMCHelper: Body Mass Index Calculator in Java

## Introduction

**MultiGen** is a graphical application written in Java to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's height and weight. This project was created to learn about Java and is made available to the public for those who are also interested in this programming language and want to understand some of its syntax. IMCHelper is a useful tool for Java learners as it offers a simple and clear graphical interface for performing BMI calculations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

* **Main.java**: Contains the main method to start the application.
* **CalculatorIMC.java**: Implements the functionality of the BMI calculator.
* **InterpretateIMC.java**: Provides the interpretation of the calculated BMI value.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TuUsuario/IMCHelper.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd IMCHelper
```

3. Compile the code:
```sh
javac Main.java CalculatorIMC.java InterpretateIMC.java
```

4. Run the application:
```sh
java -cp bin src.main.java.com.imc_helper.Main
```

## How It Works

When you run the program, a window will appear with fields to enter weight and height, and a button to calculate the BMI. Pressing the button will calculate the BMI and provide an interpretation based on standard categories.

### Main Components
